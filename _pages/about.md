### About
Data scientist with a PhD in statistics and a background in actuarial mathematics. I wrote my PhD thesis at the [Copenhagen Causality Lab](https://www.math.ku.dk/english/research/spt/cocala/) under the supervision of Professor [Jonas Peters](http://web.math.ku.dk/~peters/). My interests and research are within the fields of data science, causality, econometrics, and machine learning.

### News 
* 31<sup>st</sup> of May, 2022: The last project of my PhD thesis 'Structure Learning for Directed Trees' written in collaboration with [Rajen D. Shah](http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~rds37/) (Cambridge), [Peter BÃ¼hlmann](https://math.ethz.ch/research/seminar-for-statistics/peter-buehlmann.html) (ETH Zurich) and [Jonas Peters](http://web.math.ku.dk/~peters/) (University of Copenhagen) has been accepted for publication in The Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR).
* 1<sup>st</sup> of February, 2022: I have been temporarily hired as a research assistant to finalize and submit for publication the last project of my PhD thesis.
* 4<sup>th</sup> of November, 2021: I successfully defended my PhD thesis `Causality and Generalizability: Identifiability and Learning Methods'. A corrected and maintained version of the thesis can be found on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01430)
* 1<sup>st</sup> of April, 2020: Jointly with fellow PhD students Nikolaj Thams, Phillip Bredahl Mogensen, we made a [dashboard](http://shiny.science.ku.dk/pbm/COVID19/) tracking the worldwide progress of COVID-19, which led to a [short TV interview](https://www.tv2lorry.dk/nyheder/01-04-2020/1930/ny-corona-app?autoplay=1) along with an [article](https://www.tv2lorry.dk/koebenhavn/overblik-over-corona-pandemien-her-er-appen-du-mangler). See also the [UCPH announcement](https://nyheder.ku.dk/alle_nyheder/2020/04/overblik-over-corona-pandemien-her-er-appen-du-mangler/). 
* 14<sup>th</sup> of December, 2019: The Copenhagen Causality Lab team consisting of Sebastian Weichwald, Phillip B. Mogensen, Lasse Petersen, Nikolaj Thams, Gherardo Varando and I, have won the NeurIPS competition [Causality for Climate](https://causeme.uv.es/neurips2019/). Participants were tasked with estimating the underlying causal graphs of various time series from climate data ([code](https://github.com/sweichwald/tidybench), [UCPH announcement](https://www.math.ku.dk/english/about/news/cocala-winner-c4c/), [AWS Machine Learning Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/neurips-competition-tackles-climate-data-challenges/), [Amazon Science](https://www.amazon.science/latest-news/neurips-competition-demonstrates-how-machine-learning-techniques-can-help-researchers-understand-a-changing-climate))
* 7<sup>th</sup> of September, 2018: Today I received the Danish Mathematical Society's (DMF) Thesis Prize of 2017. This prize is awarded each year to the best mathematical thesis submitted at Danish universities. ([UCPH announcement](https://www.math.ku.dk/english/about/news/dmf-thesis-prize-2018/), [DMF announcement](https://mathematics.dk/aktiviteter/nyheder/artikel/artikel/specialeprisen-2017-gaar-til-martin-emil-jakobsen-ku))
* 8<sup>th</sup> of February, 2017: I successfully defended my master's thesis `Distance Covariance in Metric Spaces: Non-Parametric Independence Testing in Metric Spaces'. My master's thesis was written under the supervision of Professor Thomas Mikosch. The thesis can be found on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03490).
