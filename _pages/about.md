### About
Data scientist with a PhD in statistics and a background in actuarial mathematics. I wrote my PhD thesis, under the supervision of Professor Jonas Peters, at the Copenhagen Causality Lab in the section for Probability Theory and Statistics. My research was primarily within the fields of statistics, causality, econometrics, and machine learning. More specifically, my research contributed to the topics of causal effect estimation, causal structure learning, and out-of-distribution generalization.

### News 
* 4<sup>th</sup> of November, 2021: I succesfully defended my PhD thesis `Causality and Generalizability: Identifiability and Learning Methods'. A corrected and maintained version of the thesis can be found on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01430)
* 1<sup>st</sup> of April, 2020: My coworkers, Martin Emil Jakobsen and Nikolaj Thams, and I have made a [dashboard](http://shiny.science.ku.dk/pbm/COVID19/) tracking the worldwide progress, which led to an [interview in Danish television today](https://www.tv2lorry.dk/nyheder/01-04-2020/1930/ny-corona-app?autoplay=1) along with an [article](https://www.tv2lorry.dk/koebenhavn/overblik-over-corona-pandemien-her-er-appen-du-mangler). See also the [UCPH announcement](https://nyheder.ku.dk/alle_nyheder/2020/04/overblik-over-corona-pandemien-her-er-appen-du-mangler/) featuring [a short video](http://video.ku.dk/fa-overblik-over-corona-pandemien-1). 
* 14<sup>th</sup> of December, 2019: I, along with a team of coworkers at UCPH, have won the NeurIPS challenge [Causality for Climate](https://causeme.uv.es/neurips2019/), in which we were given the task of estimating the underlying causal graphs of various time series from climate data ([code](https://github.com/sweichwald/tidybench), [NeurIPS presentation](https://nikolajthams.github.io/docs/slides/pres_neurips_2019.pdf), [UCPH announcement](https://www.math.ku.dk/english/about/news/cocala-winner-c4c/), [Amazon announcement](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/neurips-competition-tackles-climate-data-challenges/))
* 8<sup>th</sup> of March, 2019: I succesfully defended my Master's thesis `Greedy Learning of Causal Structures in Additive Noise Models`, which was written under the supervision of Jonas Peters (UCPH), and I can now call myself a Master of Science with a degree in Mathematics-Economics.
