### About
Data scientist with a PhD in statistics and a background in actuarial mathematics. I wrote my PhD thesis, under the supervision of Professor Jonas Peters, at the Copenhagen Causality Lab, section for Probability Theory and Statistics, University of Copenhagen. My research was primarily within the fields of statistics, causality, econometrics, and machine learning. More specifically, my research contributed to the topics of causal effect estimation, causal structure learning, and out-of-distribution generalization.

### News 
* 15<sup>th</sup> of February, 2022: I have been temporarily hired as a research assistant to finalize and submit for publication the very last project of my PhD thesis.
* 4<sup>th</sup> of November, 2021: I successfully defended my PhD thesis `Causality and Generalizability: Identifiability and Learning Methods'. A corrected and maintained version of the thesis can be found on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01430)
* 1<sup>st</sup> of April, 2020: Jointly with fellow PhD students Nikolaj Thams, Phillip Bredahl Mogensen, we made a [dashboard](http://shiny.science.ku.dk/pbm/COVID19/) tracking the worldwide progress of COVID-19, which led to a [short TV interview](https://www.tv2lorry.dk/nyheder/01-04-2020/1930/ny-corona-app?autoplay=1) along with an [article](https://www.tv2lorry.dk/koebenhavn/overblik-over-corona-pandemien-her-er-appen-du-mangler). See also the [UCPH announcement](https://nyheder.ku.dk/alle_nyheder/2020/04/overblik-over-corona-pandemien-her-er-appen-du-mangler/). 
* 14<sup>th</sup> of December, 2019: A team from the Copenhagen Causality Lab, Sebastian Weichwald, Phillip B. Mogensen, Lasse Petersen, Nikolaj Thams, Gherardo Varando and I, have won the NeurIPS competition [Causality for Climate](https://causeme.uv.es/neurips2019/). Participants were tasked with estimating the underlying causal graphs of various time series from climate data ([code](https://github.com/sweichwald/tidybench), [NeurIPS presentation](https://nikolajthams.github.io/docs/slides/pres_neurips_2019.pdf), [UCPH announcement](https://www.math.ku.dk/english/about/news/cocala-winner-c4c/), [AWS Machine Learning Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/neurips-competition-tackles-climate-data-challenges/), [Amazon Science](https://www.amazon.science/latest-news/neurips-competition-demonstrates-how-machine-learning-techniques-can-help-researchers-understand-a-changing-climate))
* 7<sup>th</sup> of September, 2018: Today I received the Danish Mathematical Society's (DMF) Thesis Prize of 2017. This prize is awarded each year to the best mathematical thesis submitted at Danish universities. ([UCPH announcement](https://www.math.ku.dk/english/about/news/dmf-thesis-prize-2018/), [DMF announcement](https://mathematics.dk/aktiviteter/nyheder/artikel/artikel/specialeprisen-2017-gaar-til-martin-emil-jakobsen-ku))
* 8<sup>th</sup> of February, 2017: I successfully defended my master's thesis `Distance Covariance in Metric Spaces: Non-Parametric Independence Testing in Metric Spaces'. My master's thesis was written under the supervision of Professor Thomas Mikosch. The thesis can be found on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03490).
